# credit: https://enescayvarli.medium.com/tryhackme-takeover-walkthrough-584d2607288d
as a beginner enumeration is really confusing
thanks to the owner above, i managed to solve it

#first step
1. nano /etc/hosts add machine ip provided by thm (futurevera.thm)
2. then i download seclists 
(my first time usng fuzzing) 
3. using the command  "$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" -u https://10.48.171.156 -fs 4605 -c"
to get the subdomain under the futurevera.thm

4. from the fuzzing we found a few subdomain: 
blog [Status: 200, Size: 3838, Words: 1326, Lines: 81, Duration: 106ms] 
Support [Status: 200, Size: 1522, Words: 367, Lines: 34, Duration: 122ms] 
Blog [Status: 200, Size: 3838, Words: 1326, Lines: 81, Duration: 101ms] 
support [Status: 200, Size: 1522, Words: 367, Lines: 34, Duration: 114ms]

5. add it to the /etc/hosts 
- blog.futurevera.thm
- support.futurevera.thm

6. access it and explore. (hint: check on ca) 
7. this where i found 
"DNS Name: secrethelpdesk934752.support.futurevera.thm"

8. add that to the /etc/hosts then try to access it 
9. boom flag !
