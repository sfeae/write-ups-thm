Problem Description:
This Rick and Morty-themed challenge, requires to exploit a web server and find three ingredients to help Rick make his potion and transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

Step by step:
1. As a beginner, I started by exploring the web server using the TryHackMe machine and browser.
2. After accessing the provided IP address, the first step in any web challenge is to inspect the page source.

While inspecting the page source, I found an HTML comment that revealed a username:

<!--
Note to self, remember username!
Username: R1ckRul3s
-->

3. In web challenges, theres a few common files directory that are build in:
/login.php
/assests
/robots.txt
/index.html
/auth.php

4. i checked one by one and found "/login.php" page and "/robots.txt" page which contains a suspicious string (where i thought it could be a password) : Wubbalubbadubdub
5. Using the credentials obtained earlier a successful authentication granted.
6. After login, a page with a command execution was available. Using "la" command to see other files directory.

Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt (suspicious file)
assets
clue.txt
denied.php
index.html
login.php
portal.php
robots.txt

[ first ingredient ]
7. using "less" command to see the content of the file, this revealed the first ingredient.
why not cat? cat command was disable so i need to find alternative command

[ second ingredient ]
8. Next, I checked clue.txt, which hinted to look around the filesystem. 
9. Then, "ls /home" which listed the second ingredients files.
total 12 
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Feb 10 2019 . 
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Feb 10 2019 .. 
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Feb 10 2019 second ingredients

10. Using the same method as before, I read the file and obtained the second ingredient.

[ final ingredient ]
11. To locate the final ingredient, sudo permissions were used "sudo -l".
This revealed that certain commands could be executed with elevated privileges without a password.
"(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/ls"

12. Using the "/root" directory and the final ingredient file was accessed, revealing the last ingredient required for Rick’s potion.
